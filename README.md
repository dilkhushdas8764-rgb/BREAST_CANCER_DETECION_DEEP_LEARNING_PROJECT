# BREAST_CANCER_DETECION_DEEP_LEARNING_PROJECT

This project focuses on developing a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras to detect breast cancer based on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.


#OBJECTIVE

To analyze breast cancer data and preprocess it for deep learning.

To build, train, and evaluate a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras.

To accurately classify tumors as malignant or benign.

To demonstrate the application of deep learning in healthcare.
